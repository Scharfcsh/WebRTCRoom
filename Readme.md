# WebRTC Connection: Step-by-Step Guide

This document provides a comprehensive explanation of the steps involved in establishing a peer-to-peer (P2P) connection using WebRTC. WebRTC enables real-time communication capabilities, such as audio, video, and data transfer, directly between browsers without requiring additional plugins.

## **Overview of the Connection Process**
Establishing a WebRTC connection involves two major phases:
1. **Signaling Process**: Exchange of metadata (offer, answer, and ICE candidates) through a signaling server.
2. **Media Streaming**: Sending and receiving media (audio, video) or data streams between peers.

Below are the detailed steps for each phase.

## **1. Signaling Process**
The signaling process involves the exchange of Session Description Protocol (SDP) and ICE candidates to set up a P2P connection. Hereâ€™s how it works:

### **Browser 1** (Initiating Peer):
1. **Create an `RTCPeerConnection`:**
   - Create a new instance of `RTCPeerConnection` to handle the P2P connection.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const pc = new RTCPeerConnection(configuration);
     ```

2. **Create an Offer:**
   - Generate an offer SDP using `createOffer()`.
     ```javascript
     const offer = await pc.createOffer();
     ```

3. **Set the Local Description:**
   - Assign the generated offer SDP to the local description.
     ```javascript
     await pc.setLocalDescription(offer);
     ```

4. **Send the Offer:**
   - Transmit the offer to the other browser (Browser 2) via a signaling server.

### **Browser 2** (Receiving Peer):
5. **Receive the Offer:**
   - Obtain the offer from the signaling server.

6. **Set the Remote Description:**
   - Assign the received offer SDP to the remote description.
     ```javascript
     await pc.setRemoteDescription(offer);
     ```

7. **Create an Answer:**
   - Generate an answer SDP using `createAnswer()`.
     ```javascript
     const answer = await pc.createAnswer();
     ```

8. **Set the Local Description:**
   - Assign the generated answer SDP to the local description.
     ```javascript
     await pc.setLocalDescription(answer);
     ```

9. **Send the Answer:**
   - Transmit the answer back to Browser 1 through the signaling server.

### **Browser 1**:
10. **Receive the Answer:**
    - Obtain the answer from the signaling server.

11. **Set the Remote Description:**
    - Assign the received answer SDP to the remote description.
      ```javascript
      await pc.setRemoteDescription(answer);
      ```

At this stage, the signaling process is complete, and the WebRTC connection is established.

## **2. Media Streaming Process**
Once the P2P connection is established, you can exchange media streams (audio/video) between peers. Below are the steps:

### **Browser 1 and Browser 2**:
1. **Request Camera and Microphone Permissions:**
   - Use `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()` to request access to audio and video streams.
     ```javascript
     const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true, audio: true });
     ```

2. **Add Media Tracks to the Peer Connection:**
   - Add the acquired media tracks to the `RTCPeerConnection`.
     ```javascript
     stream.getTracks().forEach((track) => {
       pc.addTrack(track, stream);
     });
     ```

3. **Handle Incoming Media Tracks:**
   - Listen for the `ontrack` event to handle media tracks sent by the remote peer.
     ```javascript
     pc.ontrack = (event) => {
       const remoteStream = new MediaStream();
       event.streams[0].getTracks().forEach((track) => {
         remoteStream.addTrack(track);
       });
       // Assign the remote stream to a video element
       remoteVideoElement.srcObject = remoteStream;
     };
     ```

At this point, both peers can send and receive media streams, enabling real-time communication.

## **Key Components in WebRTC**
- **RTCPeerConnection:** Handles the connection and media transfer between peers.
- **Session Description Protocol (SDP):** Contains metadata about the connection (e.g., codecs, formats).
- **Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE):** Manages NAT traversal and network connectivity.
- **Signaling Server:** A server responsible for exchanging SDP and ICE candidates (not part of WebRTC itself).

## **Example Signaling Server (Using Socket.IO)**
Here is a simple example of a signaling server:

```javascript
const io = require("socket.io")(3000);
io.on("connection", (socket) => {
  socket.on("offer", (data) => {
    socket.to(data.target).emit("offer", data);
  });

  socket.on("answer", (data) => {
    socket.to(data.target).emit("answer", data);
  });

  socket.on("ice-candidate", (data) => {
    socket.to(data.target).emit("ice-candidate", data);
  });
});
```

By following the above steps, you can successfully establish a WebRTC connection and exchange media streams between two peers.
